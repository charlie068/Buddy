       <p>Normal working hours are from 0700 to  1900, Monday to Friday. During these hours there is a porter on duty at  reception and there are first aiders on the premises. This enables a rapid  response in the event that something goes wrong.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>All those working out of hours are expected to have  a good working knowledge of the&nbsp;emergency procedures, since they may be the  first to discover something that requires action.</li>
         <li>A person may work alone in an office, on paperwork,  without special permission however a remote buddy will be required.</li>
         <li>The risk assessment for any work other than office  work must have taken account of the increased risk of working out of hours.  ONLY those with the requisite skills may work out-of-hours. ONLY those who have  secured the agreement of the school safety advisor and PI and completed the  requisite OOH form may work out of hours.</li>
         <li>No-one may work alone in a laboratory area - there  must always be someone within calling distance (a buddy) who would know what to  do in the event of an emergency.</li>
         <li>Work on high risk experiments is&nbsp;<strong>FORBIDDEN</strong></li>
     
       </ul>
       <p>I have received and read and understood the current guidance  on out of hours working. </p>
       <p>
         I agree to abide by the directions and advice given in the  document.</p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>
